# Solo

Playing a solo on drums. Playing a solo means you are playing alone.

Solos consist of phrases. Therefore, phrasing is the most important concept in developing a solo.

A **phrase** is a series of notes that sound complete even when played apart from the main song. These are musical sentences.

A **cadence** is a two-chord progression that occurs at the end of the phrase. For melodic instruments there are half-cadences (HC), authentic cadences (AC), plagal cadence (PG), and deceptive cadence (DC). Authentic cadences can be perfect (PAC) and imperfect (IAC).

Pay attention to phrases and cadence points. Cadence point is an equivalent to the end of the line in poetry.

Phrases are usually 2-bar, 4-bar, or 8-bar long.

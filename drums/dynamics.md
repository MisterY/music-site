# Dynamics

An excellent overview of dynamics marks can be found in the book Band Expressions ([link](https://books.google.at/books?id=vRdhuchMvZoC&pg=PP5)).

A good introductory video on dynamics ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOWApRns4MA)).

## Dynamic levels

_fff = fortississimo_ = loudest
_ff = fortissimo_ = louder
_f = forte_ = loud, full stroke ~5 inches, center
_mf = mezzo forte_ = medium loud, center
_mp = mezzo piano_ = medium soft, off the center
_p = piano_ = soft, strike at ~2 inches off the center
_pp = pianissimo_ = softer
_ppp = pianississimo_ = softest

One of the main ways to control dynamics with a drumset is adjusting the stick height when striking a drum / cymbal.
Another way to increase the volume would be to use the stick shoulder to hit the drum/cymbal.

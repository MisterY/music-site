# Dynamics

An excellent overview of dynamics marks can be found in the book Band Expressions ([link](https://books.google.at/books?id=vRdhuchMvZoC&pg=PP5)).  
A good introductory video on dynamics ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOWApRns4MA)).

## Dynamic Levels

There are eight dynamic levels. Listed here are from loudest to softest:

* _fff = fortississimo_ or triple-forte = as loud as possible
* _ff = fortissimo_ = very loud
* _f = forte_ = loud, (approx. full stroke ~5 inches, in the center of the drum)
* _mf = mezzo forte_ = medium loud (center)
* _mp = mezzo piano_ = medium soft (off the center)
* _p = piano_ = soft (strike at ~2 inches off the center)
* _pp = pianissimo_ = very soft (play above the middle of the drum)
* _ppp = pianississimo_ = as soft as possible (play at the very top of the drum)

In addition, there are two terms for gradually increasing/decreasing the dynamics:

* _crescendo_ = increase the loudness gradually
* _decrescendo_ = decrease the loudness gradually

There are also two markings for accents, which mean that the note is played louder than the surrounding ones.

* > = accent
* sfz = louder than the standard accent (>)

One of the ways to control dynamics with a drumset is adjusting the stick height when striking a drum / cymbal.  
Another is the location at which the stick hits the drum head. The dynamic level decreases as the sticks move towards the upper end of the drum.  
One way to increase the volume would be to use the stick shoulder to hit the drum/cymbal.

## Dynamic Character

* animato - animated, lively
* sostenuto - sustained, lengthened

etc.

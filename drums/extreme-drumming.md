# Extreme Drumming

This page contains material about extreme drumming. Also known as Blast Beats or Skunk. This involves playing at high speeds, often in excess of 250 and up to 300 bpm. This type of playing is used mostly in metal playing. It can be useful, however, to improve your stamina/endurance and speed in general. Once you push your limits higher, it gets easier and more comfortable to play less intensely, which lets you focus on other elements of music.

The technique is based on the basic rudiment - single stroke roll.

## Highlights

* Switch-Grip Technique
* High Intensity Interval Training
    * Push your limits constantly

### Switch-Grip Hand Technique

This is a switch between a German and a French grip.

An exercise for this technique: 
- German grip: place hands on the table in front of you. Keep the base of the palm on the table and tap 8th notes at 120bpm for 2 4/4 bars. 
- French grip: turn the hands side-wise and continue tapping, using wrist motion for another 2 bars. Repeat all.

A good explanation of this technique is available at:

# Beat

This page contains material related to timing in terms of playing "ahead", "on", or "behind" the beat.
This contributes to the feel of the music.

## Introduction

Some say that other musicians prefer drummers who are a bit ahead of the beat. Playing ahead of the beat pushes the tune forward.

In the same way, playing behind the beat drags the song and gives a relaxed, slow motion. 

There is no right or wrong in general, only what works better for a particular piece.

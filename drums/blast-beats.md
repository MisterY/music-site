# Blast Beats

This page contains material about blast beats. This is playing at high speeds, often in excess of 250 and up to 300 bpm. This type of playing is used mostly in metal playing. It can be useful, however, to improve your stamina/endurance and speed in general. Once you push your limits higher, it gets easier and more comfortable to play less intensely, which lets you focus on other elements of music.

The technique is based on the basic rudiment - single stroke roll.

Some quite educational instructions are published by Marthyn Jovanovic. He is using switch-grip technique for the hands to reach 300 bpm.

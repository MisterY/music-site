## Roll

* Open roll = rudimental roll of two beats (no more) of each stick (from Stick Control)
* Closed roll = several rebounds to each stick movement. Produced by a slight additional pressure applied to the sticks.

Rolls are notated as tremolos, with slashes through the note stem. Each slash indicates dividing the note in two.

More info available in the [notation guide](http://web.mit.edu/merolish/Public/drums.pdf). Also, there is a difference in how the rolls are played depending on the tie between the notes:

| head                                                                  | other        |                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| <img src="/img/7-stroke-open-buzz-roll.png" width="100em" /> | is played as | <img src="/img/7-stroke-closed-roll.png" width="120em" /> |

in terms of the roll length (not the number of notes comprising the roll itself).

One useful method, but perhaps a bit draconian, to learn playing rolls is the one employed by Art Blakey:

> Blakey also received some instruction from Chick Webb, who once sat Blakey down with a snare drum and a metronome, set the metronome to a very slow tempo, and told Art to roll for a hundred beats. “And if you stop, I’ll break your skull,” Webb said. “He was a disciplinarian,” Blakey said.

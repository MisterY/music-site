# Warm-ups

Before any practice or playing, do warmup/stretching. 

In a warm-up, focus on the motion. Make it fluid and let it feel good. Do not hold position nor test your limits.

1. Jojo Mayer hand-clapping (3 min.)
2. Wrist stretch 1 (1 min.)
3. Propeller (1 min.), Arm Stretch
4. Stretch one hand (10 times)
5. Stretch both hands (10 times)

Another good stretch/warm-up tool is to just shake fingers, wrists, arms and shoulders.

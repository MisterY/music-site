# Bass Drum

To exercise different muscles, position the bass drum a bit further away. The leg *is not* forming the 90-degree angle in the knee, but a larger one.

The muscles involved:

- calf muscles, [Picture of the Calf Muscle](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/picture-of-the-calf-muscle#1)
- hip muscles, [Muscles of the Hip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscles_of_the_hip)

## Double Bass

Exercises:

- play heel-down single-stroke double bass; 5 minutes at 80 bpm, 16th notes. Speed up over time. Develop control and muscles.

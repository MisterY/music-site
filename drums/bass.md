To exercise different muscles, position the bass drum a bit further away. The leg *is not* forming the 90-degree angle in the knee, but a larger one.

## Double Bass

Exercises:

- play heel-down single-stroke double bass; 5 minutes at 80 bpm, 16th notes. Speed up over time. Develop control and muscles.

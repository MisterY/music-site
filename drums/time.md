# Time

This page is about the concept of time, as applied on the drums.

Time, or time keeping, is the first and foremost function of a drummer.

Honor the time between the notes. What you play is equally important to what you do not play.

## Subdivision

The key to successful time keeping is the ability to play the subdivisions correctly.

Subdivision is the division of the main notes of the beat.

## The New Breed / Singing

The method advised by Gary Chester.
The key to his teaching is singing. The key to keeping time is to always be aware of the tempo and feel. Practice singing of the melody. Most importantly do not count in the traditional way. This is the key. Gary found out that singing uses the creative side of the brain. His approach is about time awareness. 
Instead of counting 1/4 notes "1,2,3,4" sing the sylllable "Ta"
Strong
Practice a simple groove put in the click pulsing 1/4s and sing along “ Ta Ta Ta Ta”
Add some more syncopated BD patterns
Keep singing
When this becomes natural, add fills and sing "Ta".
Next try this without the click.

Singing along while you play the drum part
Stick to it your time sense will start to lock up
On a gig you sing softly
But Garys approach enabled you to eventually hear any tune and sing , for example, the bass guitar part while you play. In order to lock up
With any part of a tune or arrangement. Even if you can only sing the rhythm.
Working on this will enable you to completely lock in with any musical situation.
If you sing it, you can play it.
For places where you know your time is skating, start singing the 1/4 note.

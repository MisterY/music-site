This page is about the concept of time, as applied on the drums.

Time, or time keeping, is the first and foremost function of a drummer.

Honor the time between the notes. What you play is equally important to what you do play.

## Subdivision

The key to successful time keeping is the ability to play the subdivisions correctly.

Subdivision is the division of the main notes of the beat.

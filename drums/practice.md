# Practice

> “An amateur rehearses until they can do something right. An expert rehearses until they cannot make a mistake.”

Drum practice should be exercised daily. The recommended time is at least 1-2 hours.

[Niels Myrner](https://www.nkmdrums.com/design-an-effective-practice-plan/) lists the following timeframes:

- 15 Minutes/Day: Minimum to gain rewards.
- 30 Minutes/Day: Great target for an otherwise busy student.
- 1-2 Hours/Day: Good base level for a serious student.
- 3 Hours/Day: Serious student, considering music school/career.
- 6-12 Hours/Day: Typical professional work day.

Two times per week are classes with an instructor. All other days, students do their homework and exercises.

Tips:

* enjoy practice
* practice daily
* have a practice plan

Before any practice perform [warm-ups](warmup.md).

Areas to practice are listed on [Practice Elements](practice-elements.md) page.

Specific exercises are listed on [Exercises](exercises.md) page.

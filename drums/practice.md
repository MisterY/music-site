# Practice

There is a distinction between the following terms:

- Exercise: refers to physical exercise, repetition of movements, development of muscles and "muscle memory". See [Exercises](exercises.md) page.
- Rehearsal: preparing for the gig. Playing in the environment that matches the presentation environment as much as possible. For example, a band rehearsal.
- Practice: act of playing the instrument. Either in gigs, with others, or alone. Experimenting with ideas, phrases, coordination. Learning and perfecting technique as well as musical expression.

See Jojo Mayer's [explanation](https://www.facebook.com/DougMeolaDrumSpot/videos/1694062487338952/).

## General Practice

> “An amateur rehearses until they can do something right. An expert rehearses until they cannot make a mistake.”

Drum practice should be exercised daily. The recommended time is at least 1-2 hours.

[Niels Myrner](https://www.nkmdrums.com/design-an-effective-practice-plan/) lists the following timeframes:

- 15 Minutes/Day: Minimum to gain rewards.
- 30 Minutes/Day: Great target for an otherwise busy student.
- 1-2 Hours/Day: Good base level for a serious student.
- 3 Hours/Day: Serious student, considering music school/career.
- 6-12 Hours/Day: Typical professional work day.

Two times per week are classes with an instructor. All other days, students do their homework and exercises.

Tips:

* enjoy practice
* practice daily
* have a practice plan

Before any practice perform [warm-ups](warmup.md).

Areas to practice are listed on [Practice Elements](practice-elements.md) page.

Specific exercises are listed on [Exercises](exercises.md) page.

## Structure

Example lesson plan:

* Warm-ups: rudiments. (5 minutes)
* Theory/Book/Technique: (15 minutes)
* Song/Play/Form: (15 minutes)

Some plan examples below.

### 4-Stage Practice Method

Mike Johnston uses the 4-stage method:

1. non-creative, 10 minutes. Technique.
2. creative, . Practice creativity within some limits.
3. main focus, 25 min. Whatever needs to be developed.
4. musical application. Play along unknown music; Audition.

### 3 Simple Steps to Build the Perfect Drum Practice Routine

This method (see resources below) also recommends having separate parts of the practice routine:

- vegetables, things like drum rudiments, site reading, and four-way coordination.
- protein, the main goal. Things such as learning the beat to a song, transcribing, or learning a famous drum solo.
- dessert, improvisation. As you get better at improvising, you can start improvising over certain ostinato (repeated) patterns or exotic time signatures.

## Moeller

Moeller technique is an effortless multiple stroke. It is using the whole arm in the movement and includes the four main types of stroke - full, down, tap, up.

## Rimshots

Additionally, there are rimshots, involving hitting the rim and the head at the same time. In jazz, the rimshot sound can be simualted by placing one stick onto the head and hitting it with the other one.

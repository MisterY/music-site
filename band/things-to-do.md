# Things To Do

Or, rather, what *not* to do:

1. Never be late
2. Don't turn up underprepared
3. Being enthusiastic goes a long way
4. Don't "noodle" between songs
5. Rehearsals are not personal practice time
6. Don't bring bad vibes to a working environment
7. Use reliable gear
8. Have a solid repertoire
9. Don't pidgeon hore yourself. Play multiple styles of music.
10. Respect the gig you're playing.
